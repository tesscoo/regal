            <h2>The Client Experience</h2>

            <p>At Regal Wealth Group we strive to provide value to our clients on an ongoing basis.  Your specific financial needs drive our client -advisor relationship.</p>

            <p>In our initial meeting with new clients, our objective is to establish what your financial goals are, assess your current resources and analyze your personal tolerance for risk.  This data is imperative in formulating how your money should be invested.  We spend a lot of time upfront analyzing your data, so that we can formulate a financial recommendation to custom-fit your specific goals and timeline.</p>

            <img src="../images/clientadvisor.jpg" style="float:right; margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:20px;border-color:#969696;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;" width=300 height=auto>

            <p>At our next meeting, we will present you with a detailed recommendation as to how we think your assets should be allocated and why.  As a fiduciary, it is our professional duty to look out for your best interests.  We will never implement a recommendation until you are completely comfortable with it.  We strive to present you not only with your options but with our experienced, professional advice and reasoning on which option is best based on your personal situation.</p>

            <p>Once we agree upon our course of action, it is our responsibility, along with assistance from our support staff, to implement your investments.  We offer many services for our clients, and our work is not done when you leave our office.  The process of a financial plan is comprised of an ongoing relationship with you, as a valued client. </p>

            <p>We maintain your portfolio on a continuous basis -- actively monitoring and managing your accounts.  We will meet with you as often as you wish to review our progress toward your goals and revisit your personal situation.  Most of our clients choose to meet with us on an annual, semi-annual, or a quarterly basis either in-person or by telephone.  Updates and adjustments are often made when needed; if any changes arise regarding your financial situation, we urge you to notify us.  Furthermore, we encourage our clients to consider our aid in estate planning, as it is an essential part of protecting your family’s assets.</p>

            <p>We take our responsibilities as a fudiciary very seriously at Regal Wealth Group.  Throughout our relationship, we encourage you to share any input you have to offer, as we are constantly striving to exceed your expectations as a trusted advisor.  If we are not meeting your standards for quality service, please do not hesitate to tell us.  As a registered investment advisor, we believe diligence and integrity are of tremendous importance. </p>
