				<h2>Our Story</h2>
				<p>The advisors with Regal Wealth Management began helping corporate professionals in Southern California's aerospace industry with retirement planning and 401(k) rollovers during the 1980s and today, are proud to still serve many of those clients as well as their children, friends and neighbors.</p>

<img src="../images/garybill.jpg" style="float:right; padding:10px;">
<p>Gary Klein and Bill Beeler first began working together while helping Rockwell International employees as their financial planners with offices inside the Rockwell Federal Credit Union branches in Seal Beach and Downey, California.  In the late 1990s, they co-founded their own financial planning firm, Regal Advisory Services, with offices across Southern California and began serving clients from Rockwell, Boeing and other local aerospace companies.  As the firm grew with additional financial planners, their client base diversified beyond aerospace to include professionals from numerous large corporations and many successful business owners.</p>
<p>Gary and Bill’s vision was to create a firm that would provide the highest quality, objective advice possible for clients.  To this end, they began moving towards a fee-only business model and away from traditional commission-based investments products.  They also wanted to accept the role of Fiduciary with clients, which would eventually require them to separate from their long-term broker dealer relationship.  In January 2006, they left Regal Advisory Services to form Regal Wealth Management, a truly independent firm serving clients on a fee-only basis with full Fiduciary capabilities.</p>
<p>Today, our advisors’ daily experience with employer retirement accounts, pension distribution options and stock options allows us to complement and often even enhance the advice clients receive, even from most tax and estate planning professionals.  We provide clients access to those institutional money management firms that we believe are the best in the business.   And, our advisor directed trust services allow us to provide continuity for clients and their heirs by coordinating the services of highly respected corporate trustees with those of their personal accountants and estate planning attorneys.</p>
<p>Our advisors work with clients and their heirs residing throughout the United States and are very proud of our long-term, multi-generational client relationships.  As an SEC-Registered Investment Advisor we can access the best and brightest resources in the financial industry, yet as an independent, private company we are dedicated to individually serving each client.  Looking forward, Gary and Bill are committed to strategically growing the firm by adding select new clients and investing in new advisor talent to insure the firm will thrive to serve future generations.</p>
<p>We invite you to research our credentials as well as our Form ADV for more insight into our professionalism and business practices.  We are very proud of the work we have done for our clients over the years and of the trust they place in us.</p>
