            <h2>Advisor Trust Services</h2>
            <p>Many clients have created one or more trusts as part of their estate plan and as a means of ensuring that the wealth they have created passes how and to whom they choose.  Essential to the operation of these trusts and ultimately to their success of meeting client goals are two key factors:  the selection of an appropriate trustee and ongoing, appropriate management of investment assets in the trust.  At Regal Wealth Group our advisor trust services address both of these issues to help provide continuity to the next generation of wealth for our clients, their families and heirs.</p>

            <p>Our advisor trust services are a coordinated collaboration of efforts between us as your financial advisor, your estate planning attorney and the corporate trustee of your choice.  Through our financial planning work with you, we help identify when you may benefit from one or more trusts.  We then work with your estate planning attorney to determine the most appropriate type of trust or how to amend an existing trust.  The attorney then prepares the necessary trust documents, naming the trustee and naming us as investment manager to the trust.  Such collaboration allows you and your beneficiaries to take advantage of all the benefits of trusts such as tax savings, control, probate avoidance, asset protection and professional oversight, while continuing to work with Regal Wealth Group as your primary financial advisor.</p>

            <p>While many families on the East Coast have employed corporate trustees for generations, the value of corporate trustees to ensure a successful trust outcome seems to be more generally recognized across the country in recent years.  In most cases, the number one reason for choosing a trustee is to see that your wishes are carried out.  In effect the trustee stands in your shoes, handling assets in the trust in the manner you desire.  Experience has shown us that even financially sophisticated individuals and family members often find administering and managing a trust to be time-consuming and burdensome.  A corporate trustee knows what needs to happen and when, has experience correctly preparing statements and tax forms and handling trust distributions.  Also, a corporate trustee can in many cases preserve family relationships by removing the potential for any personal conflicts with the beneficiaries over trust distributions.</p>
