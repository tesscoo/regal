				<h2>Our Clients</h2>
				<p>Due to the nature of our specialty – retirement income – we work best with individuals who soon will be retiring or have recently retired with extensive wealth accumulated in employer savings plans or IRAs.  Most of our clients are corporate professionals or successful business owners desiring recommendations on all financial aspects of retirement including investments, insurance and estate planning.</p>
<p>Most of our clients wish to pursue fairly conservative investment models, with capital preservation as the primary goal, tax avoidance as the second and modest capital appreciation as the third.  Most have children and grandchildren for whom proper estate planning is needed.  They value the assistance of trusted advisors they can call for objective advice about any financial issue that may arise.  They want to feel confident about decisions concerning their money and value the education and guidance we provide. </p>
<p>Our clients are comfortable referring friends and colleagues to us.  They understand that the less time we must spend sustaining our practice, the more we are able to concentrate on anticipating and meeting their needs.   They know that we do not advertise to the general public and only wish to grow by adding a select number of clients each year.</p>
